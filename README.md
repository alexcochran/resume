# JSON Resume Template Environment

A simple, containerized dev environment for editing your [JSON Resume](https://jsonresume.org/).

This repo is equipped with a [Dev Container](https://containers.dev/) configuration that sets your editor up with
extensions and settings that will help you edit JSON files according to the [JSON Resume schema](https://jsonresume.org/schema/).
A CI/CD job also synchronizes the `resume.json` file to a GitLab Snippet, where it can be viewed by anyone and
consumed by [applications that can build JSON Resumes](https://jsonresume.org/projects/).

## Usage

The goal of this project is to provide a quick, easy way to get started with the JSON Resume format. Just fork the code
over to your profile, open the project in an environment that consumes Dev Containers, and get started.

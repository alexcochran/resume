This project makes use of [rbardini's `resumed` package](https://github.com/rbardini/resumed), which offers a CLI for JSON Resume utilities.

## Usage

This repo is equipped with a [Dev Container](https://containers.dev/) configuration that sets up a supported editor with
extensions and settings that help with editing JSON files according to the [JSON Resume schema](https://jsonresume.org/schema/).

The [JSON Resume schema](https://jsonresume.org/schema/) is configured with the editor to lint and provide field suggestions.

### Themes

The default theme for this project is [`jsonresume-theme-class`](https://github.com/jsonresume/jsonresume-theme-class). If you
want to use [a different theme](https://jsonresume.org/themes/), install one with npm and then swap the `meta.theme` value.

### Branches as Distinct Resume Versions

Different branches can be used to produce alternate versions of my resume for various jobs.
